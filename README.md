# NYC UI/UX Tech Group

This is the official repo of the [NYC UI/UX Tech Group](http://www.uiuxtech.nyc). Briefely, we are a New York City based community focused on how technology (platforms, languages, code, processes) is leveraged to implement richly designed user interfaces and user experiences that make products stand-out and promote end-user engagement. No fluff, no bullshit - how it is actually done.

Here you will find speaker decks, sample code and reference material related to community presentations. Please clone this repo, inspect and expand your knowledge! Should you have any questions or problems, file an [issue](https://github.com/chrisalexander55/nyc-uiux-tech/issues).

## Pull Requests

Generally, we only accept PRs from NYC UI/UX Tech Group presenters. However, if you discover a factual inconsistency or code bug, go ahead and submit a PR. We will review it and, if warranted, merge it.
